# ChaiOneUtils #

This project houses a few useful Objective-C utilities, category methods, and helpers that can simplify writing applications using Objective-C.

## Getting the code ##

Just add it as a submodule to your project.  We generally place these in a sister folder called lib.

```
git submodule add https://github.com/chaione/ChaiOneUtils.git lib/ChaiOneUtils
```

## Contributing ##
